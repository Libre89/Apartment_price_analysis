# About the analysis of advertised apartment prices in the Czech Republic.

This program analyses selected dispositions of apartments in different locations. It compares the prices of apartments in Prague, Brno, Ostrava (the 3 largest cities in the Czech Republic) and Olomouc (the 6th largest city in the Czech Republic). It compares the disposition of apartments 1+kk, 2+kk and 3+kk.

## User settings
The user can set their own analysis parameters. The user can change the selection of cities in the variable 'city_all' and the dispositions of the flat in the variable 'flat_type'.

# Analysis 
The method of analyzing all available data was employed because the data set was not extensive enough to necessitate sampling. This approach ensured that the results are based on the entirety of the available information, thereby minimizing the risk of bias and providing the most accurate and comprehensive insights possible.

This analysis processed a total of XXX apartments. However, some advertisements do not provide the price of the property and have therefore been excluded from this analysis. The number of properties analysed and the number of incompletely advertised properties is shown below.

The next chart is a boxplot showing the distribution of apartment prices in selected locations and dispositions. This boxplot allows us to quickly compare the price spread of apartments between different locations and types of dispositions and identify any trends or deviations.
